# Image-Transform-Project
This project was the last programming assignment in Coursera's Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++ course.
The project is about manipulating images with some specific functions like grayscale,illinify,etc...
I developed the HSLAPixel Class and programmed the functions to do the desired functionality with the help of using the PNG library to load the images to my program.
My program was evaluated by the unit tests provided by the course.

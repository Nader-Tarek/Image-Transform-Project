# Image-Transform-Project
This project was the last programming assignment in Coursera's Object-Oriented Data Structures in C++ course.
The project is about manipulating images with some specific function like grayscale,illinify,etc...
I developed the HSLAPixel Class and programmed the functions to do the desired functionality with the help of using the PNG library to load the images to my program.
